# Who am I? 
I'm Lucca Nolasco from Brazil. 
Currently, I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science at UESB (Universidade Estadual da Bahia). 

# Knowledge and Interests
I enjoy languages such as Java and C, as well as others used in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).I'm really interested in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and I'm studying to become an AI developer. I always saw beautty in mathematics, so I naturally became attracted to AI, since it is a field with a lot of theory involving this field and statistics.

I'm also interested in IoT and mobile programing, and seek to unify these three fields: IoT, mobile and Machine Learning. In this way, I seek to help others and solve problems.
