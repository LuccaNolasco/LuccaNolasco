### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucca Nolasco from Brazil. Currently, I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science at UESB (Universidade Estadual da Bahia). I enjoy languages such as Java and C, as well as others used in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). I'm really interested in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and I'm studying to become an AI developer.
