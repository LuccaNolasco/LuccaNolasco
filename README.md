# Who am I? 
I'm Lucca Nolasco from Brazil. 
Currently, I'm an undergraduate in Computer Science at UESB (Universidade Estadual da Bahia). 

# Knowledge and Interests 🧪 
I enjoy languages such as Java and Python (yep), along with others used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and I am actively studying to become an AI developer. Mathematics has always fascinated me, so it was only natural for me to be drawn to AI, given its heavy reliance on mathematical theory and statistics. (Yes, I also like CS theory haha!)

Additionally, I am intrigued by IoT and mobile programming, and I aim to integrate these three fields: IoT, mobile development, and Machine Learning. By doing so, I hope to contribute to solving real-world problems and assisting others.
